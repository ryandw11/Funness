# GUI Counter

To use open up the command line at the location of the jar and use this command:
```
java -jar Counter.jar {key1} {key2}
```
{key1} is the key that would make the counter count up.  
{key2} is the key that would make the counter count down.  
```
java -jar Counter.jar 7 4
```
That would count up when the 7 key is pressed or when the number pad 7 key is pressed.  
By default the keys are a for up and s for down.
